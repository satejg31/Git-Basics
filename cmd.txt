a] git init => initialize the directory

b] git status => get current status of the repository
Here we can also see all the files that are created in the repository and its
changes are not been registered so here we have created a temp.txt file and 
that particular changes are not mentioned so we get an warning after we fire the 
git status command.

c] git add temp.txt => Add the file to the repositry
Here we have added and then this is reflected when we again fire the command 
git status.

d] git commit -m "Description of commit"
Here we are commiting the repo to the git and here we also give the normal 
descriptive line for the same.

e] git restore --staged <file name> 
Here we unstage the added file to change it again add to repo

Fired the git restore --staged <file name>

After this we can again add the file to the repo and then commit it to the repo
