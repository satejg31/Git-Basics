a] git init => initialize the directory

b] git status => get current status of the repository
Here we can also see all the files that are created in the repository and its
changes are not been registered so here we have created a temp.txt file and 
that particular changes are not mentioned so we get an warning after we fire the 
git status command.

c] git add temp.txt => Add the file to the repositry
Here we have added and then this is reflected when we again fire the command 
git status.

d] git commit -m "Description of commit"
Here we are commiting the repo to the git and here we also give the normal 
descriptive line for the same.

e] git restore --staged <file name> 
Here we unstage the added file to change it again add to repo

Fired the git restore --staged <file name>
After this we can again add the file to the repo and then commit it to the repo

f] git log => We will get the log file means the trace of all the changes that were 
made to this repo in the whole history. Basically the track of all the commits made
to the repo

If we deleted a file by mistake we can get it back by getting the hash code 
from the git log and then fire the git reset command and then nextly,
we have the deleted file back but its not reflecting.
when we fire the git status command we can see that it prompts you have deleted an xyz file 
you can restore it immediately but you can also keep it in stash means you can use the same 
when you want it back.

h] git stash 
This will send the changes made to the repo in the backgroubd it wont be reflected 
dont forget to add the files to the git repo 
git add .
git stash
